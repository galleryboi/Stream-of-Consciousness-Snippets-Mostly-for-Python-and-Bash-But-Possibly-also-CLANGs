# Stream-of-Consciousness-Snippets-Mostly-for-Python-and-Bash-But-Possibly-also-CLANGs.git

As you can probably tell by the state of the repo, I've never used Git before in my life.

Nothing in this repository is a complete project in and of itself. This one in particular will NEVER contain any completed or in-progress projects.

All you will find here are snippets that I've written, which I frequently use. 


These (or derivatives of these) can be used to improve readability, make a file less import heavy, give the code fewer operations to do under the hood, solve simple problems locally that a lot of people tend to outsource...

Or however you feel like using it.




Once again, what you WILL NOT find is a complete project that runs by itself. The most these will do is self-test - in very underwhelming manners that complete quickly, and show you the outputs and/or whether or not it's just broken script.

Enjoy!
